## Frequently Asked Questions 

# Will all 'future' posts be visible? 

Yes, unless they are otherwise protected.

# Why not use an events plugin? 

- Do you just need to ability to display content with dates in the future?
- Do you really need a fully featured events plugin?

# What other plugins are there? 

To my knowledge this is the only one that supports the block editor.

There are a few plugins on wordpress.org that support future posts.

- The Future is Now!
- Future
- Display Future Posts
- Show Future Posts on Single Post

None of these have been updated in the last 6 years!
